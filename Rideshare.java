public /*You are working on a basic inventory checker. The task is to:

Store the stock quantities for 5 items in a array (e.g., [20, 15, 30, 0, 25]).
Check each item one by one using a loop.
If any item has a quantity of 0, display "Out of stock" and skip checking the rest.
If all items are in stock (none are 0), calculate and display the total quantity and whether the stock is "Low", "Moderate", or "Good" based on total quantity:
Below 50 -> "Low Stock"
50â€“100 -> "Moderate Stock"
Above 100 -> "Good Stock"
